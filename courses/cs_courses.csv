CS 110,Computing in the Age of AI,Shaer,MM,False,This course aims to provide students with the knowledge and skills to become informed digital citizens in the age of AI, ready to navigate the digital landscape. Students will gain fundamental technical understanding of how computers, the Web, and AI work, and will study three programming languages: HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. Students will also examine and discuss societal and ethical issues related to the Web and AI technologies, and consider responsible and future use of these technologies.
CS 111,Computer Programming and Problem Solving,Staff,MM,True,An introduction to problem-solving through computer programming. Students learn how to read, modify, design, debug, and test algorithms that solve problems. Programming concepts include control structures, data structures, abstraction, recursion, and modularity. Students explore these concepts in the context of interactive programs, data processing, and graphics or audio, using the Python programming language.
CS 111L,Lab: Computer Programming and Problem Solving,Staff,,True,This is a required co-requisite laboratory for CS 111.
CS 111M,Computer Programming and Problem Solving,Staff,MM,True,This is a Maurer Public Speaking course, and this course (CS 111M) incorporates both lecture and lab into one section; there is no need to register for a separate lab. This course provides multiple opportunities to learn and practice public speaking skills.
CS 111X,Computer Programming and Problem Solving,Staff,MM,True,Students in this section will complete self-directed weekly labs. This section is intended for students who have some previous programming experience, but would benefit from more before taking CS 230. Students unsure about whether to take CS 111, CS 111X, CS 111M, CS 112, CS 230, or CS 230X as their first Wellesley CS course should complete the CS placement questionnaire.
CS 112,Intro Computing for the Sciences,"Sandu, Teich",MM,True,An introduction to problem-solving through computer programming with special focus on application to problems relevant to physics, chemistry, and biology. Students learn how to read, modify, design, debug, and test algorithms that solve problems. Programming concepts include control structures, problem solving strategies, abstraction, recursion, and modularity. Students explore these concepts in the context of interactive programs, data processing, and graphical and numerical analysis, using the Python programming language. Students are required to attend a 2.5-hour lab where they will apply concepts learned in lecture to study topics at the intersection of chemistry and physics. Topics might include: chemical kinetics, numerical integration, molecular dynamics, computational biology, Monte Carlo techniques, and basic statistical analysis.

CS 121,Intro to Game Design,Tynes,MM,False,Video games are a popular form of interactive media that engage players in dynamic experiences through unprecedented combinations of storytelling, visualization, interactivity, and multi-sensory immersion. This course will introduce students to video game production and concepts. We will develop a framework for critically analyzing this medium, learn to identify effective strategies for creating games and describe what elements of design impact the final experience of a game. We’ll also identify the function of user agency in this medium to better understand how players are affected by representation in video games. Throughout the course, students will be asked to apply these concepts while building their own games and become familiar with the fundamentals of video game design.
CS 200,OO Programming Studio in Java,"Kakavouli, Delcourt",MM,False,CS 200 introduces students to Java, and the Object Oriented Model of programming with hands-on instruction and experience, using active learning pedagogical approaches. Students will gain knowledge and reinforcement in fundamental programming and programming-related skills, including problem decomposition into smaller and more manageable sub-problems, designing in the Object Oriented Model, programming in Java, practicing fundamental constructs like conditionals, looping, usage of basic Data Structures, as well as debugging and testing techniques. In addition, attention will be paid in developing skills around project management, pair and team work, and identifying and evaluating reliable resources for the task at hand. With successful completion of this course, students are expected to be independent programmers and learners, and effective team members.
CS 204,Intro to Web Development,Anderson,MM,False,This course introduces modern web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. JavaScript is explored in detail, including scoping, closures, objects, classes, object-oriented programming, and modules. The jQuery library is also introduced, and the course covers event handling and Ajax interactions. Students will build web pages that manage data structures using menus and forms, and that save/restore that data from local storage resulting in a persistent, dynamic web application. Designed web pages will be modern, responsive, and accessible. The course also covers Bootstrap and the jQuery UI (User Interface) library.
CS 220,Human-Computer Interaction,Staff,MM,False,Human-Computer Interaction is one of the areas that have transformed the way we use computers in the last 30 years. Topics include methodology for designing and testing user interfaces, interaction styles (command line, menus, graphical user interfaces, virtual reality, tangible user interfaces), interaction techniques (including use of voice, gesture, eye movements), design guidelines, and user interface software tools. Students will design a user interface, program a prototype, and test the results for usability.
